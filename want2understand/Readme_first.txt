########## What is this folder for ? ###########

# Thanksfully, Oomura teacher previously selected 7 main articles
# which we want to understand in the context of 新学術領域 

######### notation for these' file names  #########

##  prefixes 1~7 is main articles Omura teacher selected.
##  prefixes num_sup is supplementary documents for num
##  	ex. 5_sup is supplementary information for 5.
##  The number num_1,2,3 or ... is supporting theses, which will be updated. 
##  	ex. 3_1_Nathaniel... is a support theses for 3. 
##
  
# For understanding these articles, some codes for reproducing results 
# or for illustrative figures will be updated in the tools. 
# Currently, dist_GUI is updated. Asakura wrote dist_GUI for seeing 
# effects of each parameters of distributions. (and also for just learning object ;) )


######### Light explanation of each theses ############ 

Recommended order of reading is: 5 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6 ->  4 -> 1,2

##### 1.Doya-学習仮説-モノアミン.pdf ##### 
review article of computational theories of neurotransmitters. 

Method : detailed information for computational theories are not written, here. 

##### 2.Daw2005nn1560.pdf ##### 
This is the original article describing model-based and model-free idea. ( Iwami said ) 

Method : theoretically, prove existence of model-based and model-free structure.
	They integrated q-learning method and Bayes theory. 
	Very technical, difficult to read. 


##### 3_Voon-2015-Addiction.pdf ##### 
They showed human with disorders of compulsivity use model-free system, experimentally.

Method : Basic q-learning method. 

Note that reading series of publication by Nathaniel Daw is fun. 
They take the step from theoretical prediction(2.) to demonstrative research from small scale to large 
in healthy humans(3_1,3_2,etc...), and research on human with disorders(3.) ( ＾∀＾). 

#####  4.Tryptophan制限-modelbased.pdf ##### 
Sorry, i do not understand this article much .

Method : Basic q-learning method ( as is 3. ) 

#####  5.Miyazaki-2018.pdf ##### 
Serotonin effect on the time scale of reward prediction in terms of prob. of reward, 
reward quantity, and timing of reward. 

Method : Bases decision theory was used. 
( but this way of results tells us how we should interpret it, 
	and how fragile statistical approach, maybe ( ・∇・)   ) 

##### 6.Iigaya-DRN-2018.pdf ##### 
existing two decision making system based on time length of inter trial intervals. 

Method : several types of q-learning method ( different from 3.) 
	EM algorithm for estimation, and one of the information criteria, iBIC , was used.

##### 7.Mizoguchi-2015PNAS.pdf #####
methamphetamines cause rates to overestimate reward 
by interpreting q-learning parameters. 

Method : simple q-learning method ( simper than 3 )
